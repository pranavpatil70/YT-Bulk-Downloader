## Customization
You can customize the script to suit your needs:
- **Change Output Format**:
  Modify the `format` option in the `ydl_opts` dictionary to download videos in a different format or quality.
  ```python
  ydl_opts = {
      'format': 'best[ext=mp4]',  # Change to 'bestvideo+bestaudio' for best quality
      'outtmpl': '%(title)s.%(ext)s',
  }
  ```

- **Change Output Directory**:
  Add the `outtmpl` option with a directory path to save videos in a specific folder:
  ```python
  ydl_opts = {
      'format': 'best[ext=mp4]',
      'outtmpl': 'downloads/%(title)s.%(ext)s',  # Saves videos in a 'downloads' folder
  }
  ```

## Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling to ensure it continues downloading even if one URL fails. If an error occurs, it will print the error message and move on to the next URL.
